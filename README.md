# CPI-Inflation-Analysis-Excel

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key economic indicator used to measure inflation and changes in the cost of living over time. The primary objective of this project is to explore and interpret CPI trends both on a monthly and annual basis, offering a clearer understanding of how inflation evolves and affects various sectors of the economy.
Leveraging historical CPI data—primarily sourced from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics—the analysis examines price fluctuations across multiple major expenditure categories, including:
Food and Beverages
Housing (including rent and utilities)
Transportation (fuel, vehicles, public transit)
Healthcare
Education and Communication
Recreation and Apparel
Using Excel-based tools such as pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting, the project breaks down inflation patterns within each category, compares year-over-year and month-to-month changes, and visualizes macroeconomic shifts in a user-friendly format. Key performance indicators (KPIs) and trendlines are used to identify periods of rapid inflation or deflation, sector-specific volatility, and long-term pricing trends.
